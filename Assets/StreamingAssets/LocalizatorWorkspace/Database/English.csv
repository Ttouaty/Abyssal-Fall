tuto_sequence_01_message_01;Hello there, and welcome to <br/><color=red>Abyssal Fall</color>.
tuto_sequence_01_message_02;I'm going to teach you the game's basics so you can understand why you lost to your friends. :)
tuto_sequence_01_message_03;In this game the only rule you have to remember is:
tuto_sequence_01_message_04;<br/><color=maroon>Stay on the arena!</color>
tuto_sequence_01_message_05;The main thing is that:<br/> <color=green>any tile you touch</color> will<color=red> fall</color>.
tuto_sequence_01_message_06;Go ahead try to move to the next checkpoint with the <color=teal>left stick</color>
tuto_sequence_02_message_01;Awesome!
tuto_sequence_02_message_02;Congratulations!
tuto_sequence_02_message_03;Incredible!
tuto_sequence_02_message_04;...
tuto_sequence_02_message_05;Hum sorry, I had my ""Free to play"" mode active...
tuto_sequence_02_message_06;Anyway, here you can <color=green>cross small gaps</color> just by <color=green>walking across them</color>.
tuto_sequence_02_message_07;It's not a bug, It's a feature!<br/>Try it, just move right and you go right across.
tuto_sequence_03_message_01;Nice, let's try something slightly more tough.
tuto_sequence_03_message_02;In the arena, enemies will try to attack you (obviously)
tuto_sequence_03_message_03;You can use a <color=green>dash</color> to dodge attacks, <br/>jump across gaps, <br/>and even <color=green>counter some projectiles</color> if timed correctly.
tuto_sequence_03_message_04;Just <color=red>tap</color> the <color=green>A</color> button to do a <color=red>short dash</color>. <br/> <color=red>Hold</color> it to do do a <color=red>long dash</color>.
tuto_sequence_04_message_01;You can also use a dash to <color=green>push back</color> your enemies
tuto_sequence_04_message_02;Try it on this <color=teal>magic</color> wall, it should open up to let you pass.
tuto_sequence_05_message_01;Wow...
tuto_sequence_05_message_02;That will be cheap to replace right ?
tuto_sequence_05_message_03;...
tuto_sequence_05_message_04;shit
tuto_sequence_05_message_05;Well, since you are here,  <br/><color=red>don't</color> press the <color=teal>Y</color> button to use you special attack.
tuto_sequence_05_message_06;I'll go get a quotation for that wall, I'll be right back.
tuto_sequence_06_message_01;Yeah, I figured you'd do that... <br/>Joke's on you, I've got a quotation for both these walls !
tuto_sequence_06_message_02;...
tuto_sequence_06_message_03;afterlife walls are so freaking expensive...
tuto_sequence_06_message_04;You know what?! <br/>Last lesson: How about you <color=red>jump down</color>?!
tuto_sequence_06_message_05;You'll get back to the <color=teal>main menu</color> and I won't have to sell my balls to pay for more of your damage!
