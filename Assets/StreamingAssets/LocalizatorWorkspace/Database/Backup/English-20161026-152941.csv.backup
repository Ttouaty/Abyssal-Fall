tuto_sequence_01_message_01;Hello there, and welcome to <color=red>Abyssal Fall</color>'s tutorial.
tuto_sequence_01_message_02;"I'm going to teach you the game's basics so you can hide your lack of skill behind a fake wall of knowledge. ;)"
tuto_sequence_01_message_03;In this game the only rule you have to remember is:
tuto_sequence_01_message_04;<color=green>You have to stay on the arena!</color>
tuto_sequence_01_message_05;On any arena every <color=red>tiles will fall</color> after you step on it!
tuto_sequence_01_message_06;Go ahead try to move to the next checkpoint with the <color=teal>left stick</color>
tuto_sequence_02_message_01;Awesome!
tuto_sequence_02_message_02;Wow!
tuto_sequence_02_message_03;Incredible!
tuto_sequence_02_message_04;...
tuto_sequence_02_message_05;"Hum sorry, I had my ""Free to play"" mode active..."
tuto_sequence_02_message_06;Anyway, here you can <color=green>cross small gaps</color> just by <color=green>walking across them</color>.
tuto_sequence_02_message_07;It's not a bug, It's a feature!
tuto_sequence_03_message_01;Nice, let's try something slightly more tough.
tuto_sequence_03_message_02;In the arena, enemies will try to attack you (obviously)
tuto_sequence_03_message_03;You can use a <b><color=green>dash</color></b> to dodge attacks, jump across gaps, and every <color=green>counter some projectiles</color> if timed correctly.
tuto_sequence_03_message_04;"Just <b><color=red>tap</color></b> the <color=green>A</color> button to do a <color=red>short dash</color>.
<b><color=red>Hold</color></b> it to do do a <color=red>long dash</color>."
tuto_sequence_04_message_01;You can also use a dash to <color=green>push back</color> your enemies
tuto_sequence_04_message_02;Try it on this <color=teal>magic</color> wall, it should open up to let you pass.
tuto_sequence_05_message_01;Wow...
tuto_sequence_05_message_02;That will be cheap to replace right ?
tuto_sequence_05_message_03;...
tuto_sequence_05_message_04;shit
tuto_sequence_05_message_05;Well, since you are here, <color=red>don't</color> press the  <color=teal>X</color> to use you special attack.
tuto_sequence_05_message_06;I'll go get a quotation for that wall, I'll be right back.
tuto_sequence_06_message_01;"Yeah, I figured you'd do that...
Joke's on you, I've got a quotation for both these walls !"
tuto_sequence_06_message_02;...
tuto_sequence_06_message_03;afterlife walls are so freaking expensive...
tuto_sequence_06_message_04;You know what?! Last lesson: How about you <color=red>jump down</color>?!
tuto_sequence_06_message_05;You'll get back to the <color=teal>main menu</color> and I won't have to sell my balls to pay for more of your damage!
